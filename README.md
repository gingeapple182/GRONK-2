# GRONK-2: Electric boogaloo
## Overview
GRONK 2 is a personal project, serving as a spiritual successor to my first-year uni project.\
The goal is to collect all the coins and reach the end without dying. While the core mechanics are currently focussed on movement, I plan to introduce light combat elements in the future.

### Features
- Platforming mechanics
- Coin collection
- Custom and Open-Source assets - Using Open-Source assets for the world, however character, enemy and UI elements are all custom

## To-do
- [ ] Add background to title cards
